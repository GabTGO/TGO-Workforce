"""Session-backed auth, wired to the Zoho OAuth login flow.

The session itself is a signed, httpOnly cookie (Starlette's SessionMiddleware,
added in app/main.py) holding nothing but the account id — no secrets, and it
can't be read or tampered with from JavaScript. get_current_account() resolves
that id to a live Account row (or None if there's no session, the account was
deleted, or it's been deactivated). require_account() is the same check for
routes that should outright reject a signed-out request instead of treating
it as "acting as System" (see app/api/routes/employees.py for that pattern).
