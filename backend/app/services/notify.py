"""Shared helper for creating in-app notifications. Call this from any
endpoint whose action other people should hear about — the same spirit as
app/services/activity_log.py's record_activity(), but for a personal,
dismissable inbox rather than a permanent audit trail. The two are often
called together for the same event (one row per recipient here, one shared
row there); they are not a replacement for each other.
